# Object oriented programming

## Overview

In this semester you'll learn a lot of new things. Put OOP Practicum in SUSI as elective course since it gives you 2 credits and is basically free credits for the course, since you learn the same things. The lector is very chill, calm, funny, helpful, and you'll have a good time in lections. After control 1 if you have 75 points you can do a project that will be the equvalation of the exam. I advice you to try to get a project and do it. If you have made an impression to the lector, even if you don't have enough points, ask nicely and he'll probably try to make something for you. It takes a lot of time, but if you do it good you will get nice points and dont have to go to an exam. I would say go to seminars, because there you'll understands new concepts and the things learned in lections. Practicum is good, but if you have a project to work on, maybe go if you have questions about the project.
