## Overview

The doctor is very calm and understands that we are in FMI, so the course grade is made from an essay and presentation. The essay is given before may i believe. If you want to skip most of English, ask for a presentation in the start of the course and just do it next time. After that just skip all the subject until the essay and after you write the essay you can stop going to the subject.
