# Geometry

## Overview

A lot of things are in common from linear algebra from semester 1. \
The lecture notes consist of definitions, but the theorem proofs need to be written from the lectures in the faculty. Do not skip lectures, write everything down. (there isn't a textbook, just the notes that the docent is teaching) 

## Problems/Tasks

There is a folder that contain problems for solving.
