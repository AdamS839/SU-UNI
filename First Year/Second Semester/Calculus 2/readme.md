# Calculus 2

## Overview

The professor is very good and friendly and will answer you if you have a question about the topics of the subject. The subject itself is very hard, compared to Calculus 1, but most of the theorems and definitions are very similar to Calculus 1. At this moment (2024/2025) there are themes that do not have presentations from the professor, but from a textbook from another professor. Those topics are alot and if you want to understand them more, I suggest go to lectures and just write them. Its a way to hear how the lector is explaining them and you'll have 2 variants of the same thing - one from the lector, and one from the textbook. Personally, I have used the writings from the lectures, since they look kind of easier compared to the textbook. Again, try to secure some extra points for the theory exam - they will come in handy.

## Subject Overview
Understand the integrals that started in semester 1 and build up to definite integrals (Riemann and Darboux integrals) and their properties. After that, you learn Power Series, then move to functions with higher variables and learn about their differentiation and integrability. Most theorems that apply to them have huge similarity and were used in the first semester but with 1 variable (Weierstraße, Fermat, Taylor, Lagrange, etc.)

## Study Materials
Again, like first semester, the professor uploads the presentations in an easily accessible location.

## Additional Resources
Again, if you didn't watch 3Blue1Brown video about the essence of calculus, go watch it: [**playlist here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)

In folder *Lecture Notes*, there are notes that do not have presentations about them and the lector has put notes from the textbook that are marked in red.
