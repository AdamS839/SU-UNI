# Calculus 2

## Overview
Understand the integrals that started in semester 1 and build up to definite integrals (Riemann and Darboux integrals) and their properties. After that, you learn Power Series, then move to functions with higher variables and learn about their differentiation and integrability. Most theorems that apply to them have huge similarity and were used in the first semester but with 1 variable (Weierstra√üe, Fermat, Taylor, Lagrange, etc.)

## Study Materials
Again, like first semester, the professor uploads the presentations in an easily accessible location.

## Additional Resources
Again, if you didn't watch 3Blue1Brown video about the essence of calculus, go watch it: [**playlist here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)

In folder *Lecture Notes*, there are notes that do not have presentations about them and the lector has put notes from the textbook that are marked in red.
