# Control Exams Overview

Control Exams are very important (but not mandatory) as they evaluate the understanding and knowledge gained in seminars and practical sessions.

## Exam Structure

- Each exam includes **4 problems** - the head assistant evaluates and **1 theoretical question**, which is evaluated directly by the professor.

## Scoring System

- Control Exams are worth up to **110 points** each. 
- If you accumulate **300 points** or more across all 4 exams, you will be exempt from the semester's task exam.
- Every last question on the control exam is a theoretical question - the points of this question are bonus to the points you get on the theoretical exam in the session.
- **Note:** The theoretical exam is mandatory and cannot be skipped.
