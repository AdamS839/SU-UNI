# Calculus 1

Calculus 1 is about understanding limits of sequences, series, functions, and their applications. You build up to derivatives and are introduced to basic concepts of indefinite integrals, with a deeper focus on integrals and problem-solving reserved for Calculus 2.

Calculus is arguably the best math course of this semester since it is not very difficult to study. Most of the theorems and definitions are applied in seminars, and the assistant provides introductory lessons for each new section (sequences, series, functions, derivatives, and integrals). The theorems are relatively easy to remember.

Study materials include lecture notes and the professor's presentations, which will be posted in an easily accessible location.
