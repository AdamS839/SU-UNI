# Algebra theory exam (1 - writing a theme from the conspect, 2 - talking with assistants for a talk grade)

1. Pull a theme from the conspect (the themes are scattered on a table and you legit just pull one)
2. Write whatever you think - avoid wrong definitions and proofs (meaning you must know what you write)
3. Give the sheet to the docent to check what you wrote
4. Go outside with your written themes (the themes you had to write from which the assistants will ask you questions) (they don't really check the themes you wrote)
5. If you got more than grade 3.00 on the sheet you wrote, an assitant will ask you some questions you need to answer (they don't ask that hard questions and give you bonus points on the talk mark)
6. The assistant writes a grade for you on the talk exam)
7. Go to the docent again to write you the mark you got in the student book
8. That's it! You passed!
