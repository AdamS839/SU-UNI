# C++ Introduction

# Overview
If you have studied any other programming language like C#, Java, Python, ect. I don't believe it'll be hard for you. I don't think you'll have any issues about the course itself - the lections are enjoyable, the professor is cool and funny and wants to teach you.
- Seminars are good for asking question about what you don't understand in lections and for group solving the problem tasks the assistant gives.
- Practicums are purely for solving problems and for you to start thinking about better ways to code

(just be careful around the ███████) 

# More Info
Adding every week worth of exercises in practicums and seminars, plus self preparation from the lectors file with exercises.
  Will remain private.
