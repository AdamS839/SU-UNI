# No written theory questions

### *OLD* I have put the theory questions that I wrote

I would say that it is better for you to personally write the questions for the exam.

Look in the site of the lector, there are videos that you can watch from different years (of course watch the newest ones) \
If you can't find something, I'd say you aren't looking hard enough. \
There are google drives that contain the written questions, just look for them or ask people around.
