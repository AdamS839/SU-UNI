### About

This repository is a collection of my work and studies from the first semester. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the subjects I'm covering.

### Planning time

I dont have specific date to update other folders since i don't have a graphic tablet to write notes in, so i use notebooks and i don't write very
good, so i'll leave them for now

- **Algebra** - Homework and maybe some self preparation tasks
- **Discrete Structures** - Homework
- **Calculus** - Self preparation tasks
- **Introduction to Programming** - Continuous updates throughout the semester
