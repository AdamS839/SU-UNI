# First semester

I'm still new, there are a lot of things I don't know yet. This repository and info in readme files will change during this semester, so I'll leave info. 


### Some things to say
Go on lections, skip the beginning of C++ lections if you are more advanced, but still go on lections. Ask questions after lections if you don't understand something. Professors and assistants want you to question
them if you don't understand something, so ask them. In the moment you don't know or in the break.

Go around and ask assistants or upper course students to give you notes to study from them. Most of the notes will be sent to your group in facebook if you have one.
