### About

This repository will remain private until I pass my first course in FMI.

### Planning time

~~I dont have specific date to update other folders since i don't have a graphic tablet to write notes in, so i use notebooks and i don't write very good, so i'll leave them for~~

Updating folders is easier since I won't add notes, I will just stick to adding info in each readme file in courses.

- **Algebra** - Homework and maybe some self preparation tasks
- **Discrete Structures** - Homework and studying tips
- **Calculus** - Control exams and info about studying
- **Introduction to Programming** - Continuous updates throughout the semester - practicum problem weeks
