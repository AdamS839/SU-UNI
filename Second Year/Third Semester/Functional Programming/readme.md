# Functional Programming

## Overview

You will learn about Scheme and Haskell. The first half of the semester is Scheme, the next is Haskell. During the semester there will be:
 - 2 control exams
 - blitz tests - theoretical questions from the pdf lections
 - project (if you have 60 points or more)
 
 - theoretical exam
 - practical exam (you can skip the practical if you pass the project).

I have added every problem from the seminars and published each lection.
